# Create Ex

This project was generated using **Create Ex**, a powerful TypeScript-based CLI tool that bootstraps a modular Express API application with optional Prisma database integration.

## Features

- **TypeScript:** Built entirely with TypeScript for better developer experience, type safety, and enhanced code quality
- **Modular API Structure:** Routes, controllers, services, helpers, and mappers
- **Optional Web Socket Integration:** Real-time communication using Socket.IO with TypeScript support and modular event handling
- **Optional Database Integration:** Optional Prisma or Drizzle support with multiple database providers:
  - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org)
  - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com)
  - [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
  - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- **Option Eslint Integration**
- **Automated Setup:** Initialize Git, install dependencies, and configure project settings effortlessly

## Project Structure

A brief overview of the key folders in this project:

```bash
/src
├── controllers     # HTTP request handling logic
├── routes          # API endpoints definitions
├── services        # Business logic and data processing
├── helpers         # Utility functions and shared logic
├── mappers         # Data transformation functions
└── middlewares     # Express middleware (e.g., error handling, logging)
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have your project up and running, here are a few ideas to further enhance your application

- _Extend Your Routes_: Add new endpoints and corresponding controllers to handle additional features.
- _Integrate Middleware_: Customize or add middleware as your application requirements evolve.
- _Expand Your Database Models_: If using Prisma, update your Prisma schema and generate new models to support additional data entities.
